## Using Docker in This Project

### Why Docker?

Docker makes it easy to run our Java app in any environment without worrying about dependencies or configurations. It packages everything the app needs into a container, ensuring it runs the same way everywhere.

### How It Works

Instead of setting up Java manually, Docker runs the app in an isolated container with all the necessary dependencies. This way, you don’t need to worry about Java versions or local setups—it just works, no matter the platform.
